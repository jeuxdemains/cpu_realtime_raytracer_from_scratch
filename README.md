This is a software based real-time ray tracer coded from scratch coded in C++.
It demoes just the very basics of the ray tracing in real-time using CPU horse power only.

You will need SDL2 to draw the pixels on the graphical context or you can simply replace it with GDI+ on Windows or the applicable alternative for your platform.
